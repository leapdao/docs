# Becoming a Validator 

## Where to get started ?

To apply for a Validator spot in the Leap Network is pretty easy. You just have to set up a node and guarantee a 24/7 Uptime. We provide you with an easy explanation how you can set up a node. 

[Explenation - Hoe to set up a Node](#)

After the Setup of the node you have to provide your signer key and the tendermint key and a contact. Fill out this Sign Up form and you can be a part of the slot auction with your Validator.

[Sign Up - Register as a Validator](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQtc5LoEyWkc5-86SOLW3xK8cRNwuByC7SIrA9MdWeAiuBZw/viewform)

If you have problems or question to the Validator application prozess, join the LeapDAO slack and ask you question in the Validator channel or contact XXXXX


## Do Validators need to be publicly identified ?

As a Validator you don't have to be publicly registered or have a registered business. LeapDAO only needs a contact and your public ethereum address which you have to provide in the sign up form.


## What are the responsiblilities of a Validator ?

As a Validator you have three main responsibilities to keep your node running. 
1. Continuously founding your validator key with Ethereum to be able to pay the Transaction cost on the Ethereum mainnet

2. Make sure you can offer a 24/7 Uptime of your Validator. This is important that your Validator doesn't get slashed when he goes offline.

3. During the time Leap DAO will provide Updates for the Node. You as a Validator has to make sure to have the latest update of the software. Otherwise you have to install the latest version as soon as possible.


## What Hardware do I need ?

Due to proof of Stake the hardware to running a node can be pretty simple. In theory a respberry pi would be powerfull enough. However you have to gurantee the uptime and you should be able to run the latest software.


## How high are the Operational costs ?

The Operational costs depend on your hardware costs and the transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet which depending on the ETH price. We created a table with an monthly transaction cost overview. As you can see the monthly costs are anywhere between XXX and XXX depending on the amount of traffic on the chain and the ethereum price.

## What are the Operational risks ? 

We see the following risks to be a validator:

* **Slashing Risk** - Submission of invalid blocks / submission of two blocks with the same height.

* **Market Risk** - Low token market valuation / rising Ether gas prices consume validatorsâ€™ profits.

* **Centralization Risk** - The creation of validator cartels is a central critique to the PoS design.

* **Regulatory Risk** - Various laws affecting validators and/or users of network.

This section answers commons questions for new validators.

## Where to get started ?

To apply for a validator slot in the Leap Network you need to:
1. set up a node
2. sync to the top of the network
2. provide 24/7 uptime

A in-detail explanation of how to set up a node can be found here:

[Explenation - Hoe to set up a Node](#)

After the setup of the node you have to provide your validator address, validator Id and contact email. Fill out the sign-up form and you can be a part of the slot auction with your Validator.

[Sign Up - Register as a Validator](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQtc5LoEyWkc5-86SOLW3xK8cRNwuByC7SIrA9MdWeAiuBZw/viewform)

If you have problems or question to the Validator application prozess, join the [LeapDAO slack](http://join.leapdao.org) and ask you question in the Validator channel or contact XXXXX.


## Do Validators need to be publicly identified ?

As a validator you don't have to be publicly registered or have a registered business. LeapDAO only needs a contact and your public ethereum address which you have to provide in the sign up form.


## What are the responsiblilities of a Validator ?

As a Validator you have three main responsibilities to keep your node running. 
1. Continuously founding your validator key with Ether to be able to pay the transaction cost on the Ethereum network.

2. Make sure you keep your validator online 24/7. This will prevent slashing of the staked tokons for being offline.

3. From time to time updates will be released for the node software. Validators have to run latest versions of the software to provide correct service.


## What Hardware do I need ?

Due to proof of stake the hardware requirements for running a node are low. In theory a Respberry Pi is powerfull enough. However you have to gurantee the uptime and you should be able to run the latest software.

## How high are the Operational costs ?

The operational costs depend on your hardware costs and the transaction costs on the Ethereum network which depending on the Ether price. We created a table with an monthly transaction cost overview.

![Operator costs](/img/val-img4.svg "Overview monthly costs per slot")

As you can see the monthly costs are anywhere between USD 7 and USD 750 depending on the Ether price. The amount of traffic on the chain can further affect the cost.

## What are the Operational risks ? 

We see the following risks for validators:

* **Slashing Risk** - Submission of invalid blocks / submission of two blocks with the same height.

* **Market Risk** - Low token market valuation / rising Ether gas prices consume validators' profits.

* **Centralization Risk** - The creation of validator cartels is a central critique to the PoS design.

* **Regulatory Risk** - Various laws affecting validators and/or users of network.

Now you should have dApp working on Leap network.  
We haven't covered cancelRound functionality, since you can do it in different ways. 
But it should be trivial if you simply follow the code we wrote to resolve round.

All source code is also available in [Leap Word Game Repository](https://github.com/MaxStalker/leap-word-game) on GitHub.
